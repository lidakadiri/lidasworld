    <p>I have a huge passion for reading and writing. I have always for comfort in reading and the endless possibilities that come with writing a story. I have been writing stories for as long as I could write and creating stories as long as I could talk.</p>
    
    <p class="bookp">My favourite book is from a series called 'Legendborn'. It follows our protagonist, Bree Matthews, who is starting at university and is also navigating grief after the death of her mother. Bree discovers a secret society at the University of North Carolina. Bree uncovers hidden truths about her own lineage and abilities, confronting ancient powers and dark forces. It is filled with rich mythology and is a fresh take on Arthurian legend.</p>
            
    <p class="bookp">There are 2 books in the Legendborn series so far: </p>
        <ol class="d" >
    <li>1. Legendborn</li>
    <li>2. Bloodmarked</li><!-- the numbers wont show up so I added them myself-->

                <h2 >3. Nope (2022)</h2>
                This film is a sci-fi horror that follows a man and his sister who discover something sinister in the skies above their California horse ranch, while the owner of a nearby theme park tries to profit from the mysterious, otherworldly phenomenon. It features some of my favourite actors such as Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer, and Steven Yeun.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I can watch these films a million times over. Here's a clip from my favourite part of of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. This scene was huge turning point for Miles and was a culmination of all his progress throughout the films so enjoy :&#41;.</p>
