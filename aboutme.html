    <h4>Me</h4>
    <p>My name is Khalidat but I also go by Lida and I am 20 years old. I was born on the 1st March 2003 (making me a Pisces) in Waterford and I've lived in Waterford my whole life. My favourite colour is blue (if you couldn't tell from them colour scheme of this website) and I love baking.</p>

    <h4>Family</h4>
    <p>I have two brothers, one older and the other younger. Their names are Khalid and Khamil. My brother and I are exceptionally close and I would consider them to be my best friends. The 3 of us live together and spend a lot of time with one another but we wouldnt have it any other way.</p>

    <h4>Journal</h4>
    <p>I also have a journal that I write in daily just to jot my thoughts down after the day which I find to be really theraputic. I have found that journalling makes me feel infinitely more productive than usual which is super helpful during college. I log things like the average daily temperate, my mood as well as thoughts in it. I can't commend journalling enough or how beneficial it can be and will forever sing its praises </p>

    <h4>Baking</h4>
    <p class="baking">Baking has probably been my most consistent pastime throughout my life. I have been baking since I was 9 years old after watching YouTube videos on a channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RosannaPansino/featured" target="_blank" >Nerdy Nummies</a> which inspired me to pick up baking myself. My favourite thing to bake are cinnamon rolls with cream cheese icing because I love making dough based recipes because even when they're a bit messy they still looks pretty.</p>
